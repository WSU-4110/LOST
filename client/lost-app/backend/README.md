# backend/env 
backend/env is the virtual environment folder for python. it has all of the libraries that are being used in the dev.py file, inside of it. any dependencies will go here. 

# To activate the virtual environment (which must be done if you want to run the dev.py file) 
you must use "source env/bin/activate" command (You just have to do it in the backend folder, not inside the environment). 

# dev.py is the backend development file 
dev.py file is used to do oauth and create other functions relating to the entirety of the project(ie. create playlist, add attribute, etc)
